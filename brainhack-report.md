#Introduction
Data analysis software and canonical datasets are the driving force behind many
fields of empirical sciences. Despite being of paramount importance, those
resources are most often not adequately cited. Although some can consider this
a “social” problem, its roots are technical: Users of those resources often are
simply not aware of the underlying computational libraries and methods they
have been using in their research projects. This in-turn fosters inefficient
practices that encourage the development of new projects, instead of
contributing to existing established ones. Some projects (e.g. FSL
\cite{smith2004advances}) facilitate citation of the utilized methods, but such
efforts are not uniform, and the output is rarely in commonly used citation
formats (e.g. BibTeX). DueCredit is a simple framework to embed information
about publications or other references within the original code or dataset
descriptors. References are automatically reported to the user whenever a given
functionality or dataset is being used.

#Approach
DueCredit is currently available for Python, but we envision extending support
to other frameworks (e.g., Matlab, R).  Until DueCredit gets adopted natively by
the projects, it provides the functionality to “inject” references for 3rd
party modules.

For the developer, DueCredit implements a decorator `@due.dcite` that allows to
link a method or class to a set of references that can be specified through a 
doi or BibTeX entry. For example (from PyMVPA):

```
@due.dcite(
    Doi('10.1016/j.neuron.2011.08.026'),
    description="Hyperalignment of data to a ...",
    tags=["implementation"])
def train(self, datasets):
    """Derive a common feature space ...
    ....
```

The end-user simply needs to run the script loading the `duecredit`
module. For example, with the following minimal script

```
# A tiny analysis script to demonstrate duecredit
#
# Import of duecredit is not necessary if you just run
# this script with
#    python -m duecredit
# import duecredit  # Just to enable duecredit
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

print("I: Simulating 4 blobs")
data, true_label = make_blobs(centers=4)

dist = pdist(data, metric='euclidean')

Z = linkage(dist, method='single')
print("I: Done clustering 4 blobs")
```

by running it with `python -m duecredit`, we get a summary of the packages 
and methods used

```
$python -m duecredit example_scipy.py
I: Simulating 4 blobs
I: Done clustering 4 blobs

#Results
The initial release of DueCredit (0.1.0) was implemented during the OHBM 2015
hackathon and uploaded to pypi and is freely available. DueCredit provides a
concise API to associate a publication reference with any given module or
function. For example: To provide a reference for an entire module the cite
function can be used, while functions and methods can be conveniently decorated
using dcite. DueCredit comes with a simple demo code which demonstrates its
utility. Running a sample analysis produces a summary of references. At each
run, the information is stored in a pickled file, and incremental runs update
that file. Thus, DueCredit summary can be used to show that information again
or export it as a BibTeX file ready for reuse.


# Conclusions
DueCredit is in its early stages of development, but two days of team
development at the OHBM hackathon were sufficient to establish a usable
prototype implementation.  Since then, the code-base was further improved and
multiple beta-releases followed, expanding the coverage of citable resources
(e.g., within scipy, sklearn modules via injections and PyMVPA natively).
